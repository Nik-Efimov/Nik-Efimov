### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nikolay Efimov
I am studying the profession of data analyst at the Yandex Practicum course. At the moment, 9 training projects on data preprocessing, automation, statistical analysis, cohort analysis and A/B testing have already been completed. The topic of SQL has been studied, knowledge of window functions has been gained in practice. I have practical skills of working in Tableau, creating dashboards.

I want to develop further in data analysis, gain new knowledge and apply it in practice.
